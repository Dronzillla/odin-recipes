    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Tilapia is a freshwater white fish with a pleasantly flaky texture and mild flavor. It's one of the most popular types of fish in the United States because it's inexpensive, easy to find, and easy to prepare.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are plenty of delicious ways to season tilapia, but we're partial to the flavors found in this recipe: salt, pepper, lemon juice, flat-leaf parsley, and fresh thyme. If you want to spice things up a bit, try adding garlic and/or cayenne pepper.
