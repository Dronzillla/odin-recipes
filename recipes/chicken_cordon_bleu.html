    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked.
    </p>
    <p>
        Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard.
